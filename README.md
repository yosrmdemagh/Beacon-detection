During my summer internship in 2023, 
I worked on a project that involves detecting beacon cards using an ESP32 card. 
The system is capable of sending this data to a database for storage.
This project aims to program an ESP32 card to detect a beacon card.
This card is a component of another system designed to determine whether
security agents in an establishment are effectively carrying out their task of controlling the establishment.
To test this code, you can use either the Arduino IDE or VS Code. 
You will need an ESP32 card and a beacon card. 
Once you have these, you can upload the code to the ESP32 card
